  <h1>My Art</h1>

  <p>I enjoy working with different medeums such as drawing and photography but my favorit is digital imaging.</p>
  <p>I love that you are able to change the world around you to create a story that couldn't have origenaly been told through</p>
  <p>either strictly photography or with the limitations of what you are able to draw.</p>
